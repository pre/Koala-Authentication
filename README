Koala Authentication
====================

Single Sign On plugin for Ruby on Rails.

PLEASE NOTE: 

This cannot be used as a standalone plugin (yet). 
I will probably extract the missing parts from my projects' code, 
but that will happen "later".


Configuration
=============
Copy "setup_files/koala_authentication_config.rb" to "RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers".
